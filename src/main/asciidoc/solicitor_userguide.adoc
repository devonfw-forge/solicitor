== Introduction
Todays software projects often make use of large amounts of Open Source software. Being
compliant with the license obligations of the used software components is a prerequisite for every such project. This results in different requirements that the project might need to fulfill. Those requirements can be grouped into two main categories:

* Things that need to be done to actually fulfill license obligations
* Things that need to be done to monitor / report fulfillment of license obligations

Most of the above activities share common points:

* The need to have an inventory of used (open source) components and their licenses
* Some rule based evaluation and reporting based on this inventory

In practice these easy looking tasks might get complex due to various aspects:

* The number of open source components might be quite large (>> 100 for a typical webapplication based on state of the art programming frameworks)
* Agile development and rapid changes of used components result in frequent changes of the inventory
* Open Source usage scenarios and license obligations might be OK in one context (e.g. in the relation between a software developer and his client) but might be completely inacceptable in another context (e.g. when the client distributes the same software to end customers)
* Legal interpretation of license conditions often differ from organisation to organisation and result in different compliance rules to be respected.
* License information for components is often not available in a standardized form which would allow automatic processing
* Tools for supporting the license management processes are often specific to a technology or build tool and do not support all aspects of OSS license management.

Of course there are specific commercial tool suites which address the IP rights and license domain. But due to high complexity and license costs those tools are out of reach for most projects - at least for permanent use.

_Solicitor_ tries to address some of the issues hightlighted above. In its initial version it is a tool for programmatically executing a process which was originally defined as an Excel-supported manual process.

When running _Solicitor_ three subsequent processing steps are executed:

* Creating an initial component and license inventory based on technology specific input files
* Rule based normalization and evaluation of licenses
* Generation of output documents

=== Licensing of Solicitor
The _Solicitor_ source code and accompanying resources (including this userguide) as stored in the GIT Repository https://github.com/devonfw-forge/solicitor are itself licensed as Open Source under Apache 2 license (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

== Architecture
The following picture show a business oriented view of _Solicitor_.

image:domain_model.png[width=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

Raw data about the components and attached licenses within an application is gathered by _scanning_ with technology and build chain specific tools. This happens outside _Solicitor_.

The _import_ step reads this data and transforms it into a common technology independent internal format.

In the _normalization_ step the license information is completed and unified. Information not contained in the raw data is added. Where possible the applicable licenses are expressed by https://spdx.org/[SPDX-IDs].

Many open source compontents are available via multi licensing models. Within _qualification_ the finally applicable licenses are selected.

In the _legal assessment_ the compliance of applicable licenses will be checked based on generic rules defined in company wide policies and possibly project specific project specific extensions. Defining those rules is considered as "legal advice" and possibly needs to be done by lawyers which are authorized to do so. For this step _Solicitor_ only provides a framework / tool to support the process here but does not deliver any predefined rules.

The final _export_ step produces documents based on the internal data model. This might be the list of licenses to be forwarded to the customer or a license compliance report. Data might also be fed into other systems.

A more technical oriented view of _Solicitor_ is given below.

image:solution.png[width=100%,scaledwidth=100%]

There are three major technical components: The _reader_ and _writer_ components are performing import and export of data. The business logic - doing _normalization_, _qualification_ and _legal assessment_ is done by a _rule engine_. Rules are mainly defined via _decision tables_. _Solicitor_ comes with a starting set of rules for _normalization_ and _qualification_ but these rulesets need to be extended within the projects. Rules for legal evaluation need to be completely defined by the user.

_Solicitor_ is working without additional persisted data: When being executed it generates the output direcly from the read input data after processing the business rules.

=== Data Model

image:datamodel.png[width=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

The internal business data model consists of 6 entities:

* *`ModelRoot`*: root object of the business data model which holds metadata about the data processing
* *`Engagement`*: the masterdata of the overall project
* *`Application`*: a deliverable within the `Engagement`
* *`ApplicationComponent`*: component within an `Application`
* *`RawLicense`*: License info attached to an `ApplicationComponent` as it is read from the input data
* *`NormalizedLicense`*: License info attached to an `ApplicationComponent` processed by the business rules

For the mechanism how _Solicitor_ resolves the content of URLs and how the result
might be influenced see <<Resolving of License URLs>>

===== License types
Defines the type of license

* `OSS-SPDX` - An OSS license which has a corresponding SPDX-Id
* `OSS-OTHER` - An OSS license which has no SPDX-Id
* `COMMERCIAL` - Commercial (non OSS) license; this might also include code which is owned by the project
* `UNKNOWN`- License is unknown
* `IGNORED`- license will be ignored (non selected license in multi licensing case; only to be used as "Effective Normalized License Type")

===== Pseudo License Ids
A "normalized" license id might be either a SPDX-Id or a "pseudo license id" which is used to indicate a specific situation. The following pseudo license ids are used:

* `OSS specific` - a nonstandard OSS license which could not be mapped to a SPDX-Id
* `PublicDomain` - any form of public domain which is not represented by an explicit SPDX-Id
* `Ignored` - license will be ignored (non selected license in multi licensing case; only to be used as "Effective Normalized License")
* `NonOSS` - commercial license, not OSS

== Usage
=== Executing Solicitor
_Solicitor_ is a standalone Java (Spring Boot) application. Prerequisite for running it is an existing Java 8 runtime environment. _Solicitor_ is executed with the following command:

[listing]
java -jar solicitor.jar -c <configfile>

where `<configfile>` is to be replaced by the location of the <<Basic Configuration File>>.

To get an overview of the available command line options use

[listing]
java -jar solicitor.jar -h

.Adressing of resources
****
For unique adressing of resources (configuration files, input data, rule templates and decision tables) _Solicitor_ makes use of the Spring ResourceLoader functionality, see https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#resources-resourceloader . This allows to load from the classpath, the filesystem or even via http get.
****

=== Configuration File
The main configuration of _Solicitor_ is done via a configuration file in
JSON format. This configuration file defines the engagements and applications master data, configures the readers for importing component and license information, references the business rules to be applied and defines the exports to be done.

The config file has the following skeleton:

[listing]
{
  "comment" : "Sample Solicitor configuration file",
  "engagementName" : "DevonFW", <1>
  .
  .
  .
  "applications" : [ ... ], <2>
  "rules" : [ ... ],  <3>
  "writers" : [ ... ] <4>
}

<1> The leading data defines the engagement master data, see <<Engagement Master Data>>
<2> `applications`  defines the applications within the engagement and configures the readers to import the component/license information, see <<Readers / Applications>>
<3> `rules` references the rules to apply to the imported data, see <<Business Rules>>
<4> `writers` configures how the processed data should be exported, see <<Writers / Reporting>>

NOTE: The following section describes all sections of the _Solicitor_ configuration file format. Often the configuration of `writers` and especially `rules` will be identical for projects. To facilitate the project specific configuration setup _Solicitor_ internally provides a default base configuration which contains reasonable defaults for the `rules` and `writers` section. If the project specific configuration file omits the `rules` and/or `writers` sections then the corresponding settings from the default configuration will be taken. For details see <<Default Base Configuration>>.

WARNING: If locations of files are specified within the configuration files as relative
pathnames then this is always evaluated relative to the current working directory (which
might differ from the location of the configuration file). If some file location
should be given relative to the location of the configuration file this might be done
using the special placeholder `${cfgdir}` as described in the following.

==== Placeholders within the configuration file
Within certain parts of the configuration file (path and filenames) special placeholders might be used to parameterize the configuration. These areas are explicitely marked in the following
description.

These placeholders are available:

* `${project}` - A simplified project name (taking the engagement name,
removing all non-word characters and converting to lowercase).
* `${cfgdir}` -  If the config file was loaded from the filesystem this denotes the directory where the config file resides, `.`  otherwise. This can be used to reference locations relative to the location of the config file.

==== Engagement Master Data
The engagement master data is defined in the leading section of the config file.

[listing]
  "comment" : "Sample Solicitor configuration file", <1>
  "engagementName" : "DevonFW", <2>
  "engagementType" : "INTERN", <3>
  "clientName" : "none", <4>
  "goToMarketModel" : "LICENSE", <5>
  "contractAllowsOss" : true, <6>
  "ossPolicyFollowed" : true, <7>
  "customerProvidesOss" : false, <8>

<1> is a free text comment (no further function at the moment)
<2> the engagement name (any string)
<3> the engagement type; possible values: INTERN, EXTERN
<4> name of the client (any string)
<5> the go-to-market-model; possible values: LICENSE
<6> does the contract explicitely allow OSS? (boolean)
<7> is the companies OSS policy followed? (boolean)
<8> does the customer provide the OSS? (boolean)

==== Applications
Within this section the different applications (=deliverables) of the engagement are defined. Furtheron for each application at least one reader needs to be defined which imports the component and license information.

[listing]
 "applications" : [ {
    "name" : "Devon4J", <1>
    "releaseId" : "3.1.0-SNAPSHOT", <2>
    "sourceRepo" : "https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j.git", <3>
    "programmingEcosystem" : "Java8", <4>
    "readers" : [ { <5>
      "type" : "maven", <6>
      "source" : "classpath:samples/licenses_devon4j.xml", <7> <9>
      "usagePattern" : "DYNAMIC_LINKING" <8>
    } ]
  } ],

<1> The name of the application / deliverable (any string)
<2> Version identifier of the application (any string)
<3> URL of the source repo of the application (string; should be an URL)
<4> programming ecosystem (any string; e.g. Java8; Android/Java, iOS / Objective C)
<5> multiple readers might be defined per application
<6> the type of reader; possible values: csv, maven, npm, gradle
<7> location of the source file to read (ResourceLoader-URL)
<8> usage pattern; possible values: DYNAMIC_LINKING
<9> _placeholder patterns might be used here_


The different readers are described in chapter <<Reading License Information with Readers>>

==== Business Rules

Business rules are executed within a https://www.drools.org/[Drools] rule engine. They are defined as a sequence of rule templates and corresponding XLS files which together represent decision tables.

[listing]
  "rules" : [ {
    "type" : "dt", <1>
    "ruleSource" : "classpath:samples/LicenseAssignmentSample.xls", <2> <6>
    "templateSource" : "classpath:com/.../rules/rule_templates/LicenseAssignment.drt", <3> <6>
    "ruleGroup" : "LicenseAssignment", <4>
    "description" : "setting license in case that no one was detected" <5>
  },
  .
  .
  .
,{
    "type" : "dt",
    "ruleSource" : "classpath:samples/LegalEvaluationSample.xls",
    "templateSource" : "classpath:com/.../rules/rule_templates/LegalEvaluation.drt",
    "ruleGroup" : "LegalEvaluation",
    "decription" : "final legal evaluation based on the rules defined by legal"
  } ],

<1> type of the rule; only possible value: `dt` which stands for "decision table"
<2> location of the tabular decision table data
<3> location of the drools rule template to be used to define the rules together with the decision table data
<4> id of the group of rules; used to reference it e.g. when doing logging
<5> some textual description of the rule group
<6> _placeholder patterns might be used here_

When running, _Solicitor_ will execute the rules of each rule group separately and in the order
given by the configuration. Only if there are no more rules to fire in a group _Solicitor_ will
move to the next rule group and start firing those rules.

Normally a project will only customize (part of) the data of the decision tables and thus will only change the `ruleSource` and the data in the XLS. All other configuration (the different templates and processing order) is part of the _Solicitor_ application itself and should not be changed by end users.

See <<Working with Decision Tables>> and <<Standard Business Rules>> for further information on the business rules.

==== Writers / Reporting
The writer configuration defines how the processed data will be exported and/or reported.

[listing]
  "writers" : [ {
    "type" : "xls", <1>
    "templateSource" : "classpath:samples/Solicitor_Output_Template_Sample.xlsx", <2> <6>
    "target" : "OSS-Inventory-DevonFW.xlsx", <3> <6>
    "description" : "The XLS OSS-Inventory document", <4>
    "dataTables" : { <5>
      "ENGAGEMENT"  : "classpath:com/devonfw/tools/solicitor/sql/allden_engagements.sql",
      "LICENSE" : "classpath:com/devonfw/tools/solicitor/sql/allden_normalizedlicenses.sql"
    }
  } ]

<1> type of writer to be selected; possible values: `xls`, `velo` 
<2> path to the template to be used
<3> location of the output file
<4> some textual description
<5> reference to SQL statements used to transform the internal data model to data tables used for reporting
<6> _placeholder patterns might be used here_

For details on the writer configuration see <<Reporting / Creating output documents>>.

== Reading License Information with Readers
Different Readers are available to import raw component / license information for different 
technologies. This chapter describes how to setup the different build / dependency management systems to create the required input and how to configure the corresponding reader.

=== Maven

For the export of the licenses from a maven based project the license-maven-plugin is used.
To configure the plugin some changes needs to be done in the pom.xml, like in the
following example
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
      <artifactId>license-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.14</version>
      <configuration>
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/generated-resources</outputDirectory>
        <sortArtifactByName>true</sortArtifactByName>
        <includeTransitiveDependencies>true</includeTransitiveDependencies>
        <failOnMissing>false</failOnMissing>
        <encoding>utf-8</encoding>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

To generate the input file required for _Solicitor_ the License Plugin needs to be executed
with the following command:

----
mvn license:aggregate-download-licenses -Dlicense.excludedScopes=test,provided
----

The generated output file named `licenses.xml` (in the directory specified in the
plugin config) should look like the following:

----
include::licenses.xml[]
----

In _Solicitor_ the data is read with the following reader config:

----
"readers" : [ {
  "type" : "maven",
  "source" : "file:target/generated-resouces/licenses.xml",
  "usagePattern" : "DYNAMIC_LINKING"
} ]
----

(the above assumes that _Solicitor_ is executed in the maven projects main directory)

=== CSV
The CSV input is normally manually generated and should look like this (The csv File is ";" separated):

[source]
----
include::csvlicenses.csv[]
----

In _Solicitor_ the data is read with the following part of the config

----
"readers" : [ {
  "type" : "csv",
  "source" : "file:path/to/the/file.csv",
  "usagePattern" : "DYNAMIC_LINKING"
} ]
----

The following 5 columns need to be contained:

* groupId
* artifactId
* version
* license name
* license URL

In case that a component has multiple licenses attached, there needs to be a separate 
line in the file for each license.

=== NPM

For the export of the the licenses from a NPM based Project the NPM License Crawler is used.
To install the crawler the following command needs to be executed.

----
npm i npm-license-crawler -g
----

To get the licenses, the crawler needs to be executed like the following example

----
npm-license-crawler --dependencies --csv licenses.csv
----

The export should look like the following (The csv file is "," separated)

[source]
----
include::licenses.csv[]

----


Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-license-crawler

In _Solicitor_ the data is read with the following part of the config

----
"readers" : [ {
  "type" : "npm",
  "source" : "file:path/to/licenses.csv",
  "usagePattern" : "DYNAMIC_LINKING"
} ]
----


=== Gradle

For the export of the licenses from a Gradle based project the Gradle License Plugin is used.

To install the plugin some changes needs to be done in `build.gradle`, like following example
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/' }
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.jaredsburrows:gradle-license-plugin:0.8.5-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'java-library'
apply plugin: 'com.jaredsburrows.license'
----

Afterwards execute the following command in the console:

For Windows (Java Application)
----
gradlew licenseReport
----

TODO: Describe specifics of Android builds

The Export should look like this:

----
include::licenses.json[]
----


Source: https://github.com/jaredsburrows/gradle-license-plugin

In _Solicitor_ the data is read with the following part of the config

----
"readers" : [ {
  "type" : "maven",
  "source" : "file:path/to/licenses.json",
  "usagePattern" : "DYNAMIC_LINKING"
} ]
----

== Working with Decision Tables

Solicitor uses the Drools rule engine to execute business rules. Business rules are
defined as "extended" decision tables. Each such decision table consists of two artifacts:

* A rule template file in specific drools template format
* An Excel (XLSX) table which defines the decision table data

When processing, _Solicitor_ will internally use the rule template to create one or multiple rules for every record found in the Excel sheet. The following points are important here:

* Rule templates:
** Rule templates should be regarded as part of the _Solicitor_ implementation and should not be changed on an engagement level.
* Excel decision table data
** The Excel tables might be extended or changed on a per project level.
** The rules defined by the tabular data will have decreasing "salience" (priority) from top to bottom
** In general multiple rules defined within a table might fire for the same data to be processed; the definition of the rules within the rule template will normally ensure that once a rule from the decision table was processed no other rule from that table will be processed for the same data
** The excel tables contain header information in the first row which is only there for documentation purposes; the first row is completely ignored when creating rules from the xls
** The rows starting from the second row contain decision table data
** The first "empty" row (which does not contain data in any of the defined columns) ends the decision table
** Decision tables might use multiple condition columns which define the data that a rule matches. Often such conditions are optional: If left free in the Excel table the condition will be omitted from the rule conditions. This allows to define very specific rules (which only fire on exact data patterns) or quite general rules which get activated on large groups of data. Defining general rules further down in the table (with lower salience/priority) ensures that more specific rules get fired earlier. This even allows to define a default rule at the end of the table which gets fired if no other rule could be applied.

* `rule groups`: Business rules are executed within groups. All rules resulting from a single decision table are assigned to the same `rule group`. The order of execution of the `rule groups` 
is defined by the sequence of declaration in the config file. Processing of the current group will
be finished when there are no more rules to fire in that group. Processing of the next group will then start. Rule groups which have been finished processing will not be resumed even if rules within that group might have been activated again due to changes of the facts.

NOTE: A concept for organizing rules into common and project specific rules is not
yet in place

== Standard Business Rules
The processing of business rules is organized in different phases. Each phase might consist of multiple decision tables to be processed in order.

=== Phase 1: Determining assigned Licenses
In this phase the license data imported via the readers is cleaned and normalized. At the end of this phase the internal data model should clearly represent all components and their assigned licenses in normalized form.

The phase itself consists of two decision tables / rule groups:

==== Decision Table: Explicitely setting Licenses
With this decision table is is possible to explicitely assign NormalizedLicenses to components. This will be used if the imported RawLicense data is either incomplete or incorrect. Items which have been processed by rules of this group will not be reprocessed by the next rule group.

* LHS conditions:
** `Engagement.clientName`
** `Engagement.engagementName`
** `Application.applicationName`
** `ApplicationComponent.groupId`
** `ApplicationCompomnent.artifactId`
** `ApplicationComponent.version`
** `RawLicense.declaredLicense`
** `RawLicense.url`

* RHS result:
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseType`
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense`
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseUrl`
** `NormalizedLicense.comment`

All RawLicenses which are in scope of fired rules will be marked so that they do not
get reprocessed by the following decision table.

==== Decision Table: Detecting Licenses from Imported Data
With this decision table the license info from the RawLicense is mapped to the NormalizedLicense. This is based on the name and/or URL of the license as imported via the readers.

* LHS conditions:
** `RawLicense.declaredLicense`
** `RawLicense.url`

* RHS result:
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseType`
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense`

=== Phase 2: Selecting applicable Licenses
Within this phase the actually applicable licenses will be selected for each component.

This phase consists of two decision tables.

==== Choosing specific License in case of Multi-Licensing
This group of rules has the speciality that it might match to a group of NormalizedLicenses associated to an ApplicationComponent. In case that multiple licenses are associated to an ApplicationComponent one of them might be selected as "effective" license and the others might be marked as `Ignored`.

* LHS conditions:
** `ApplicationComponent.groupId`
** `ApplicationComponent.artifactId`
** `ApplicationComponent.version`
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense` (licenseToTake; mandatory)
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense` (licenseToIgnore1; mandatory)
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense` (licenseToIgnore2; optional)
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense` (licenseToIgnore3; optional)

* RHS result
** license matching "licenseToTake" will get this value assigned to `effectiveNormalizedLicense`
** licenses matching "licenseToIgnoreN" will get `IGNORED` assigned to `effectiveNormalizedLicenseType` `Ignored` assigned to `effectiveNormalizedLicense`

It is important to note that the rules only match, if all licenses given in the conditions actually exist and are assigned to the same ApplicationComponent.

==== Selecting / Overriding applicable License

The second decision table in this group is used to define the `effectiveNormalizedLicense` (if not already handled by the decision table before).

* LHS conditions:
** `ApplicationComponent.groupId`
** `ApplicationComponent.artifactId`
** `ApplicationComponent.version`
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseType`
** `NormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense`

* RHS result:
** `NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicenseType` (if empty in the decision table then the value of `normalizedLicenseType` will be taken)
** `NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicense` (if empty in the decision table then the value of `normalizedLicense` will be taken)
** `NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicenseUrl` (if empty in the decision table then the value of `normalizedLicenseUrl` will be taken)

=== Phase 3: Legal evaluation

The third phase ist the legal evaluation of the licenses and the check, whether OSS usage is according to defined legal policies. Again this phase comprises two decision tables.

==== Pre-Evaluation based on common rules
Within the pre evaluation the license info is checked against standard OSS usage policies. This roughly qualifies the usage and might already determine licenses which are OK in any case or which need to be further evaluated. Furtheron they qualify whether the license text or source code needs to be included in the distribution. The rules in this decision table are only based on the `effectiveNormalizedLicense` and do not consider any project, application of component information.

* LHS condition:
** `NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicenseType`
** `NormalizedLicense.effectiveNormalizedLicense`

* RHS result:
** `NormalizedLicense.legalPreApproved`
** `NormalizedLicense.copyLeft`
** `NormalizedLicense.licenseCompliance`
** `NormalizedLicense.licenseRefUrl`
** `NormalizedLicense.includeLicense`
** `NormalizedLicense.includeSource`

==== Final evaluation
The decision table for final legal evaluation defines all rules which are needed
to create the result of the legal evaluation. Rules here might be general for all projects or even very specific to a project if the rule can not be applied to other projects.

* LHS condition:
** `Engagement.clientName`
** `Engagement.engagementName`
** `Engagement.customerProvidesOss`
** `Application.applicationName`
** `ApplicationComponent.groupId`

== Reporting / Creating output documents
After applying the business rules the resulting data can can be used to create reports and
other output documents.

Creating such reports consists of three steps:

* transform and filter the model data by using an embedded SQL database
* determining difference to previously stored model (optional)
* Template based reporting via
** Velocity templates (for textual output like e.g. HTML)
** Excel templates

=== SQL transformation and filtering

==== Database structure

After the business rules have been processed (or a Solicitor data model has been loaded via
command line option `-l`) the model data is stored in a dynamically created internal SQL database.

* For each type of model object a separate table is created. The tablename is the name of model object type written in uppercase characters. (E.g. type `NormalizedLicense` stored in table `NORMALIZEDLICENSE`)
* All properties of the model objects are stored as strings in fields named like the properties within the database table. Field names are case sensitive (see note below for handling this in SQL statements).
* An additional primary key is defined for each table, named `ID_<TABLENAME>`.
* For all model elements that belong to some parent in the object hierarchy (i.e. all objects except `ModelRoot`) a foreign key field is added named `PARENT_<TABLENAME>` which contains the unique key of the corresponding parent

==== SQL queries for filtering and transformation

Each Writer configuration (see <<Writers / Reporting>>) includes a section which references SQL select statements that are applied on the database data. The result of the SQL select statements is made accessible for the subsequent processing of the Writer via the dataTable name given in the configuration.

==== Postprocessing of data selected from the database tables

Before the result of the SQL select statement is handed over to the Writer the following postprocessing
is done:

* a `rowCount` column is added to the result which gives the position of the entry in the result set (starting with 1).
* Columns named `ID_<TABLENAME>` are replaced with columns named `OBJ_<TABLENAME>`. The fields of those columns are filled with the corresponding original model objects (java objects). 

WARNING: The result table column `OBJ_<TABLENAME>` gives access to the native Solicitor data model (java objects), e.g. in the Velocity writer. As this breaks the decoupling done via the SQL database using this feature is explicitely discouraged. It should only be used with high caution and in exceptional situations. The feature might be discontinued in future versions without prior notice.

=== Determining difference to previously stored model

When using the command line option `-d` _Solicitor_ can determine difference information between two different data models (e.g. the difference between the licenses of the current release and a former release.) The difference is calculated on the result of the above described SQL statements:

* First the internal reporting database is created for the current data model and all defined SQL statements are executed
* Then the internal database is recreated for the "old" data model and all defined SQL stements are executed again
* Finally for each defined result table the difference between the current result and the "old" result
is calculated

To correctly correlate corresponding rows of the two different versions of table data it is necessary to define explicit correlation keys for each table in the SQL select statement.
It is possible to define up to 10 correlation keys named `CORR_KEY_X` with X in the range from 0 to 9. `CORR_KEY_0` has highest priority, `CORR_KEY_9` has lowest priority.

The correlation algorithm will first try to match rows using `CORR_KEY_0`. It will then attempt to correlate unmatched rows using `CORR_KEY_1` e.t.c.. Correlation will stop, when

* all correlations keys `CORR_KEY_0` to `CORR_KEY_9` have been processed OR
* the required correlation key column does not exist in the SQL select result OR
* there are no unmatched "new" rows OR
* there are no unmatched "old" rows

The result of the correlation / difference calulation is stored in the reporting table data structure. For each row the status is accessible if

* The row is "new" (did not exist in the old data)
* The row is unchanged (no changes in the field values representing the properties of the _Solicitor_ data model)
* The row is changed (at least one field corresponding to the _Solicitor_ data model changed)

For each field of "changed" or "unchanged" rows the following status is available:

* Field is "changed"
* Field is "unchanged"

For each field of such rows it is furtheron possible to access the new and the old field value.

=== Sample SQL statement

The following shows a sample SQL statement showing some join over multiple tables and the use of
correlations keys.

NOTE: Above example also shows how the case sensitive column names have to be handled within the SQL 

=== Writers

The above dscribed SQL processing is identical for all Writers. Writers only differ in the
way how the output document is created based on a template and the reporting table data
obtained by the SQL transformation.

==== Velocity Writer
The Velocity Writer uses the https://velocity.apache.org/[Apache Velocity Templating Engine]
to create text based reports. The reporting data tables created by the SQL transformation are
directly put to the into Velocity Context.

For further information see the

* Velocity Documentation
* The _Solicitor_ JavaDoc (which also includes datails on how to access the diff information for rows and fields of reporting data tables)
* The samples included in Solicitor

==== Excel Writer

===== Using Placeholders in Excel Spreadsheets
Within Excel spreadsheet templates there are two kinds of placeholders / markers possible, which control the processing:

===== Iterator Control
The templating logic searches within the XLSX workbook for fields containing the names of the
reporting data tables as defined in the Writer configuration like e.g.:

* `\#ENGAGEMENT#`
* `\#LICENSE#`

Whenever such a string is found in a cell this indicates that this row is a template row. For each entry in the respective resporting data table a copy of this row is created and the attribute replacement will be done with the data from that reporting table. (The pattern `\#...#` will be removed when copying.)

===== Attribute replacement
Within each row which was copied in the previous step the templating logic searches for the string pattern `$someAttributeName$` where `someAttributeName` corresponds to the column names of the reporting table. Any such occurence is replaced with the corresponding data value.

===== Representation of Diff Information 
In case that a difference processing (new vs. old model data) was done this will be represented
as follows when using the XLS templating:

* For rows that are "new" (so no corresponding old row available) an Excel note indicating that this row is new will be attached to the field that contained the `\#...#` placeholder.
* Fields in non-new rows that have changed their value will be marked with an Excel note indicating the old value. 

== Resolving of License URLs

Resolving of the content of license texts which are referenced by the URLs given in `NormalizedLicense` is done in the following way:

* If the content is found as a resource in the classpath under `licenses` this will be taken. (The _Solicitor_ application might include a set of often used license texts and thus it is not necessary to fetch those via the net.) If the classpath does not contain the content of the URL the next step is taken.
* If the content is found as a file in subdirectory `licenses` of the current working directory this is taken. If no such file exists the content is fetched via the net. The result will be written to the file directory, so any content will only be fetched once. (The user might alter the files in that directory to change/correct its content.) A file of length zero indicates that no content could be fetched.

=== Encoding of URLs
When creating the resource or filename for given URLs in the above steps the following encoding scheme will be applied to ensure that always a valid name can be created:

All "non-word" characters (i.e. characters outside the set `[a-zA-Z_0-9]`) are replaced by underscores ("`_`").

== Default Base Configuration
The builtin default base configuration contains settings for the `rules` and `writers` section
of the _Solicitor_ configuration file which will be used if the project specific config file omits those sections.

[appendix]
== Extending Solicitor
`Solicitor` comes with a sample rule data set and sample reporting templates. In general it will
be required to correct, supplement and extend this data sets and templates. This can be done straightforward by creating copies of the appropriate resources (rule data XLS and template files), adopting them and furtheron referencing those copies instead of the original resources from the
project configuration file.

Even though this approach is possible it will result in hard to maintain configurations,
especially in the case of multiple projects using `Solicitor` in parallel.

To support such scenarios `Solicitor` provides an easy extension mechanism which allows
to package all those customized configurations into a single archive and reference it from the
command line when starting `Solicitor`.

This facilitates configuration management, distribution and deployment of such extensions.

=== Format of the extension file
The extensions might be provides as JAR file or even as a simple ZIP file. There is only
one mandatory file which contains (at least metadata) about the extension and which needs
to be included in this archive _in the root folder_.

[source,properties]
.application-extension.properties
----
include::../resources/samples/application-extension.properties[]
----

This file is included via the standard Spring Boot profile mechanism. Besides containing
naming and version info on the extension this file might override any
property values defined within `Solicitor`.

Any other resources (like rule data or templates) which need to be part of the Extension
can be included in the archive as well - either in the root directory or any subdirectories.
If the extension is active those resources will be available _on the classpath_ like any 
resources included in the _Solicitor_ jar.

Overriding / redefining the default base configuration within the Extension enables to
update all rule data and templates without the need to touch the projects configuration
file.

=== Activating the Extension
The Extension will be activated by referencing it as follows when starting _Solicitor_:

java -Dloader.path=path/to/the/extension.zip -jar solicitor.jar <any other arguments>
